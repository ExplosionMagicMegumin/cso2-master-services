# cso2-master-services

This repository includes all the services required to run a master server for Nexon's Counter-Strike: Online 2.

**The master server is currently in development and is missing many features.** You can keep track of the project's progress [here](https://github.com/Ochii/cso2-master-services/projects/1).

You may use [```docker-compose```](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run these services all at once, or run separate services in separate servers.

You can also get [client launcher](https://github.com/Ochii/cso2-launcher/) to use with this.

## Running all the services with ```docker-compose```

You must have installed both [```docker```](https://docs.docker.com/) and [```docker-compose```](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) in order to run the services all at once.

### Preparation

The repository has two ```docker-compose``` configuration files, `docker-compose.development.yml` and `docker-compose.production.yml`.

`docker-compose.development.yml` can be used for development environments, where `docker-compose.production.yml` can be used for development production environments (such as a remote server).

Rename the configuration file you prefer to `docker-compose.yml` so you can use it with ```docker-compose```.

### Startup

If this is your first time running the services, use ```docker-compose up -d``` to start them. If not you can use ```docker-compose start -d```.

To stop the services, enter ```docker-compose down```.
